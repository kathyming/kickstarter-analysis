# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

##Overview of Project
The purpose of the Kickstarter Analysis is to determine two things â€“ is there a better chance of success based on the month a Kickstarter campaign is launched or the goal of the campaign? 

##Analyis and Challenges
###Outcomes Based on Launch Date
*First of all, the goal was to see if there was a better time of year to launch a campaign for a theater project.  Starting with the raw data for Kickstarter campaigns, I created a pivot table which summarized the outcomes (successful, failed, or canceled) for all theater campaigns.  From the data, I created a line graph to depict the outcomes based on month of launch.

*My biggest challenge was figuring out how to display the Months in the pivot table for Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date.  At first, I could only list the Year or the Quarter.  I eventually poked around enough to discover I could use the filter for Row Labels.


###Outcomes vs Goals
*In order to determine if there is a correlation between goal amount and outcome of campaign, I used the COUNTIFS() function to separate out the campaigns by outcome into categories of goal.  I then determined percentages.

##Results
###Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Results
*June was the most popular month to launch a campaign.
*June also had the highest success rate of all the months.

###Outcomes vs Goals Results
*Success rate declines as goals increase.
*Cancelations slowly rise as goals increase. 

###Dataset Limitations
*The dataset had some extreme outliers.  There were many campaigns with goals of $1.00 which is not a realistic amount in relation to a Kickstarter campaign.  These low goals make the likelihood of success much higher.  There was another campaign with a goal of $100M, which again is an extreme outlier.
